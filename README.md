## PhotoGalleryApp

PhotoGalleryApp is a web-based photo-gallery platform designed for professional photographers and their clients. It lets photographers create and manage “projects” (photo sessions), queue and onboard clients via QR codes or unique links, bulk-upload session images, and send personalized galleries. Clients register on mobile, view only their own photos in a private gallery, favorite or download images, and receive automatic email notifications. Administrators have a dedicated panel to oversee users, moderate content, and configure subscription plans. &#x20;

### Key Features

* **Photographer Dashboard**

  * Create/edit projects: title, date, description, logo
  * Real-time client queue with search, status toggling, and clipboard-copy of names
  * Bulk image upload (auto-naming `Name_LastName_IMG_0000.jpg`) and gallery link generation
  * Automated email notifications when galleries are ready&#x20;

* **Client Interface**

  * Mobile-friendly registration via QR code or unique link
  * Personal gallery: thumbnail grid, full-size view, “Download All,” per-image download/delete/favorite controls&#x20;

* **Admin Panel**

  * Photographer user management (create, activate/pause, view)
  * Project moderation and deletion
  * Subscription plan and tariff oversight&#x20;

### Architecture & Technology Stack

* **Backend**: RESTful API in Python (Django) or Java (Jersey/Hibernate), interfacing with PostgreSQL or MySQL&#x20;
* **Frontend**: Single-page application in React or Vue, communicating via the REST API&#x20;
* **Storage**: Photos on local disk or S3-compatible service; metadata and associations in a relational database&#x20;
* **Authentication**: Third-party provider (Auth0, AWS Cognito, Firebase Auth) with email verification, MFA, and password reset&#x20;
* **Payments**: Stripe integration for recurring subscription billing&#x20;
* **Email Service**: AWS SES, Mailgun, SendGrid (or similar) for transactional notifications&#x20;

### Deployment & Security

* Containerized CI/CD on AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku with automated testing
* Enforced HTTPS, XSS/CSRF protection, encrypted password storage, and unique email validation&#x20;
* Development timeline: Prototype in 2–3 weeks; Core features in 8–10 weeks; Testing in 2–3 weeks&#x20;
